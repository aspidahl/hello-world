Greetings coders, 

Anders here (or Ders for short). I can't wait to start learning code! 
A little about myself: I spent five months on the island nation of Madagascar for study abroad, earned a B.A. in environmental studies at Gustavus Adolphus College, and currently work at a public charter school as an educational assistant. I enjoy playing music, cross-country skiing, and reading in my free time.
